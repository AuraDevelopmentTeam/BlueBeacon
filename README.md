BlueBeacon is a Python utility designed to serve as a Docker healthcheck for Minecraft servers. It automatically detects
server settings and pings the server to verify responsiveness, making it easy to monitor containerized Minecraft servers
without additional configuration.

## Features

- **Automatic Server Detection**: Automatically finds and reads Minecraft server configuration files
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works with Java Edition servers (vanilla, Spigot, Paper, Forge, Fabric, etc.), Bedrock
  Edition servers, and proxies (BungeeCord, Velocity)
- **Zero Configuration**: No need to manually specify server ports or settings
- **Standalone Binary**: Distributed as source code but compiled to a standalone binary in the Docker build process

## Usage

### As a Docker Healthcheck

Add BlueBeacon to your Minecraft server Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Add healthcheck using BlueBeacon
HEALTHCHECK --interval=5s --timeout=2s --start-period=120s --retries=3 \
    CMD ["/path/to/bluebeacon"]
```

### Command Line Options

BlueBeacon accepts one optional command line parameter:

```
bluebeacon [CONFIG_PATH]
```

Where `CONFIG_PATH` can be either:

- A specific config file path
- A directory to search for config files

If no path is provided, BlueBeacon will search the current user's home directory, which is where most Docker images
place server files.

## How It Works

1. BlueBeacon searches for Minecraft server configuration files in the specified location (or home directory by default)
2. It parses the configuration to determine the server type and port
3. It sends a ping request using the appropriate protocol (Java or Bedrock)
4. It returns a success exit code (0) if the server responds properly, or a failure code otherwise

## Distribution

BlueBeacon is distributed as source code, with a template Dockerfile that includes a build stage to compile it into a
standalone binary. This ensures no additional dependencies are needed in the final Docker image.

### Note on libc bundling

The build process uses PyInstaller to create a single-file executable and then repackages it with `staticx` to bundle
required shared libraries, including the C standard library (libc), into the final executable. This makes the binary
self-contained and not dependent on the base image's libc at runtime.

## Prebuilt Docker images for Pterodactyl

Prebuilt container images are provided for use with Pterodactyl. These images are designed to be used as base images ("
yolks") for your Eggs and are built on top of the official Pterodactyl yolk images:

- Official yolks: https://github.com/pterodactyl/yolks/pkgs/container/yolks

Registry:

- Pull URL: registry.gitlab.project-creative.net/auradev/bluebeacon:TAG
- Tag overview: https://gitlab.project-creative.net/AuraDev/BlueBeacon/container_registry/2

Key details:

- Tags align with the upstream yolk tags (e.g., `java_8`, `java_11`, `java_17`, `java_21`, as well as `java_17j9`,
  etc.).
- Each BlueBeacon image layer adds the BlueBeacon binary, and the Dockerfile includes a HEALTHCHECK that runs BlueBeacon
  automatically. No extra setup is needed â€” using these images automatically enables the container health check.
- Images are published to this project's Container Registry at the URL above.

Examples:

- Pull a specific tag with Docker:
    - `docker pull registry.gitlab.project-creative.net/auradev/bluebeacon:java_17`
- Use as a Pterodactyl image for a Java 17 server Egg:
    - Image: `registry.gitlab.project-creative.net/auradev/bluebeacon:java_17`
    - Health check: already configured and active by default (no additional configuration required).

Note: The images are built in CI using the corresponding upstream yolk as the base (e.g.,
`ghcr.io/pterodactyl/yolks:java_17`), ensuring compatibility with Pterodactyl's ecosystem.
